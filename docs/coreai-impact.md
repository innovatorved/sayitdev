# WWDC 2026 on-device AI - what it means for dev

## TL;DR

WWDC 2026 surfaced three things. **The one that matters most for dev is new: Apple shipped a
first-party `fm` CLI** (`fm respond`, `fm chat`, and `fm serve` - "a Chat Completions API server")
that directly overlaps dev's two core products. Second is the **FoundationModels OS 27 update**
(new on-device model, bigger context, new APIs). The "Core AI" rename is a non-event for dev core.

**The real story: FoundationModels gets a substantial OS 27 update.** dev is built on
FoundationModels (`LanguageModelSession`, `SystemLanguageModel`), and Apple's official updates page
confirms (not press speculation):

- A **new on-device model** (reportedly Gemini-distilled) - Apple says *"test your prompts with the
  new model."* dev must re-qualify on OS 27 (#193).
- A new **`LanguageModel` protocol** plus open-source **`CoreAILanguageModel`/`MLXLanguageModel`** -
  an official bridge to drive any model through the FoundationModels session API. This makes a
  bring-your-own-model path tractable (#195).
- **`ToolCallingMode`** and **improved error types** - adoption candidates for dev (#197).
- **On-device context window likely doubled to 8192 on OS 27** (WWDC26 session-241 prints
  `model.contextSize // 8192`); dev reads this at runtime so behavior is safe, but ~20 hardcoded
  "4096" doc references need an audit. See the corrected item #1 below for the full analysis (#192).

**The non-event: "Core AI" is just the Core ML successor.** It is a low-level tensor inference runtime
(`AIModel`/`NDArray`/`InferenceFunction`), **not** a replacement for FoundationModels, with no chat,
prompts, tool calling, or server surface. dev needs **no Core AI code** and **no migration**. Core AI
only matters as the runtime behind the new `CoreAILanguageModel` bridge above. The rest of this page
explains exactly what Core AI is and is not, so the recurring "why doesn't dev use Core AI?" question
is answered once.

## The headline for dev: Apple shipped `fm`

macOS 27 ships a **first-party `fm` command-line tool**. Its surface is nearly one-to-one with dev:

| `fm` subcommand | dev equivalent |
|---|---|
| `fm respond '...'` (+ `--stream`) | `dev "prompt"` / `--stream` (core product #1) |
| `fm serve` - *"Start a Chat Completions API server"* | `dev --serve` (core product #2) |
| `fm chat --instructions '...'` | `dev --chat` (byproduct #3) |
| `fm token-count '...'` | dev `TokenCounter` |
| `fm schema object --name Person --string name --int age` | dev `SchemaConverter` |
| `fm available` | dev availability checks |
| `fm quota-usage` | (no dev equivalent - PCC quota) |

Models: `system` (on-device, default) and `pcc` (Private Cloud Compute). Alongside `fm`, Apple shipped
a **Python SDK** (`pip install apple-fm-sdk`, repo `apple/python-apple-fm-sdk`, macOS-only / Apple
Silicon + Apple Intelligence), **open-sourced the core framework** ("runs wherever Swift runs,
including Linux servers"), and a **framework utilities package** whose building blocks include
"chat-completions interfacing (OpenAI-compatible)" - i.e. an official answer to dev product #2.

**This is the most consequential WWDC item for dev and it is not Core AI.** Honest read:

- dev's three user-facing modes (CLI, OpenAI-compatible server, chat) now all have a first-party
  equivalent. The Swift library (#4) is also undercut by the open-sourced framework + utilities
  package + Python SDK.
- Remaining dev differentiators worth pressing: **available today on macOS 26** (`fm` needs
  macOS 27, so there is an adoption-window lead); **OpenAI-compat depth and maturity** (honest 501s,
  CORS, tool calling, `response_format`, real conformance tests vs. a brand-new `fm serve`);
  **MCP client** (no MCP client surface visible in `fm`); **UNIX ergonomics** (`--json`, `NO_COLOR`,
  exit codes, stdin detection); **cross-channel install** (brew/nix) and the dev-family ecosystem.
- **Open question for triage:** is `fm serve` genuinely OpenAI-conformant (the exact question asked
  under Franz's HN post)? Worth running dev's own `openapi_conformance` suite against `fm serve` on
  OS 27 hardware to know precisely where dev is ahead.

Action: this needs a deliberate positioning decision (README + landing page) and a tracking issue.
Not started here - flagged for Franz.

## What Core AI actually is

From the framework overview (quoted from the docs):

> "Core AI helps you build, run, and deploy AI models in your app. Designed with Apple silicon
> in mind, Core AI allows your app to use the latest model architectures and inference techniques
> across the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine."

Tagline: *"Run AI models in your app on Apple silicon."*

Core AI is a low-level inference runtime. Its currency is tensors and named inference functions,
not conversations. The mental model:

1. You convert a model (e.g. from PyTorch via the **Core AI PyTorch Extensions** package) into an
   `.aimodel` file, or ahead-of-time compile it to `.aimodelc` with `xcrun coreai-build`.
2. You load and **specialize** it for the current device (`AIModel.specialize(...)`), choosing a
   preferred compute unit (`.cpu`, `.gpu`, `.neuralEngine`) and a cache policy.
3. You run inference functions on `NDArray` tensors or `CVMutablePixelBuffer` images
   (`InferenceFunction.run(inputs:...)`), synchronously or streamed via `ComputeStream`.

Key symbols: `AIModel`, `AIModelAsset`, `InferenceFunction`, `InferenceFunctionDescriptor`,
`InferenceValue`, `NDArray`, `NDArrayDescriptor`, `ComputeStream`, `ComputeUnitKind`,
`SpecializationOptions`, `AIModelCache`, `ImageDescriptor`, `AssetError`. Import is `import CoreAI`.

**Availability:** iOS / iPadOS / macOS / tvOS / visionOS / watchOS **27.0+, all Beta.** Announced at
WWDC 2026 (keynote 2026-06-08), shipping with the iOS 27 / macOS 27 generation. Building
`.aimodel` files needs the Xcode **Metal Toolchain** component.

## What Core AI is NOT

| Misconception | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Core AI replaces FoundationModels" | No. Different framework, different layer. FoundationModels is the developer-facing LLM API; Core AI is the Core ML successor (generic inference). |
| "dev must migrate to Core AI" | No. There is nothing to migrate. dev needs LLM sessions/prompts/tools, which Core AI does not provide. |
| "Core AI adds tool calling / structured output / embeddings" | No. None of these exist in Core AI. Those live in FoundationModels (and dev's own out-of-band tool layer). |
| "Core AI deprecates FoundationModels" | No. FoundationModels is untouched by the Core AI announcement. Core ML continues in compatibility mode. |
| "Core AI gives dev a new OpenAI-compatible server" | No. Core AI is purely on-device inference. No HTTP, no OpenAI compat, no MCP, no agents. |

## Where dev sits in Apple's AI stack

```
dev  (CLI + OpenAI-compatible server + chat)
  └─ FoundationModels      ← dev is built ENTIRELY on this
       (on-device LLM: sessions, prompts, guided generation, tool support, tokenCount)
  └─ Core AI               ← the Core ML successor; dev does NOT use this today
       (tensor inference runtime: AIModel / NDArray / InferenceFunction)
  └─ Apple silicon (CPU / GPU / Neural Engine)
```

FoundationModels is almost certainly implemented on top of the same runtime layer Core AI now
exposes, but dev only ever talks to FoundationModels. Core AI is the layer below the line dev
draws.

## Direct impact on dev: effectively none

- **CLI tool** (`dev "prompt"`): unaffected.
- **OpenAI-compatible server** (`dev --serve`): unaffected. Core AI has no server or
  OpenAI-compatible concept to align with.
- **Chat / MCP / tool calling**: unaffected.
- **SayItDevCore library**: unaffected. It is FoundationModels-free pure Swift; Core AI adds nothing
  it needs to model.
- **TokenCounter** (`SystemLanguageModel.tokenCount(for:)`, SDK 26.4+): a FoundationModels API,
  not a Core AI one. No change from the Core AI announcement.

The golden goal (UNIX tool + OpenAI-compatible server, on FoundationModels, 100% on-device) is
intact.

## Indirect / adjacent items worth tracking

These are the things that actually matter for dev from the WWDC 2026 / OS 27 cycle. None are
Core AI per se, but they ship in the same window and Core AI is the headline that surfaced them.

> **Update 2026-06-09: these are now confirmed by Apple's official
> [Foundation Models updates](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/foundationmodels)
> page (June 2026 / OS 27 entries), not just press reporting.** Details folded into the items below.

1. **FoundationModels context window - on-device window likely DOUBLED to 8192 on OS 27.**
   **Correction (2026-06-09):** the WWDC26 session-241
   ([video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2026/241/)) example prints
   `let model = SystemLanguageModel(); print(model.contextSize) // 8192` for the **on-device** model,
   and search corroborates 8192 for the OS 27 on-device model. This contradicts my earlier read that
   the on-device window "still reads 4096." The most likely truth: 4096 on the current (OS 26) model,
   **8192 on the new OS 27 on-device model**. The 32K figure is separate again - that is the cloud
   `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel`, which dev does not use.
   - **Behavior is safe either way:** dev reads the live value via `SystemLanguageModel.contextSize`
     (`Sources/TokenCounter.swift` -> `CLI.swift`, `Server.swift`, `Benchmark.swift`), not a hardcode.
   - **Docs are NOT safe:** the literal string **4096** is hardcoded across `README.md` (lines 23, 262,
     264, 292, 316, 401), `demo/README.md`, `docs/context-strategies.md`, `docs/integrations.md`,
     `docs/openai-api-compatibility.md`, `docs/mcp-calculator.md`, `docs/guides/index.md`,
     `docs/local-setup-with-vs-code.md`, `docs/vscode-copilot.md`, and `docs/tool-calling-guide.md`.
     If OS 27 on-device is 8192, these become wrong for OS 27 users.
   - **Do not bulk-edit yet:** confirm the real number on OS 27 hardware first (one `dev` run prints
     `context: <N> tokens`). Then decide whether docs should state a range ("4096 on macOS 26, 8192 on
     macOS 27") or point at the runtime value. Tracked separately from this page.

2. **FoundationModels base model change - CONFIRMED.** Apple's updates page states verbatim: *"the
   model changes when a person updates to iOS 27, iPadOS 27, macOS 27, and visionOS 27, test your
   prompts with the new model to verify your app's behavior."* (The new on-device model is reported to
   be distilled from Google Gemini under a multi-year Apple/Google deal.) dev inherits any change in
   tool-call formatting, refusal behavior, tokenization, or token counts. These are exactly the
   surfaces dev's recent bug fixes (#176-#183, #187) hardened, so re-qualification on OS 27 hardware
   is required, not optional.

3. **New FoundationModels APIs in OS 27 that touch dev.** The June 2026 updates also add:
   `GenerationOptions.ToolCallingMode` (control how the model interacts with tools - relevant to
   dev's out-of-band tool layer); improved error types `LanguageModelError`,
   `SystemLanguageModel.Error`, `LanguageModelSession.Error` (relevant to `SayItDevError.classify` and
   parked ticket #119); a `DynamicProfile` agentic API; and image analysis (`OCRTool`,
   `BarcodeReaderTool`). dev should evaluate whether to adopt `ToolCallingMode` and the new error
   types; the rest (image, agentic, cloud) are out of scope for dev's golden goal.

4. **macOS 27 build + runtime compatibility.** dev pins `platforms: [.macOS(.v26)]`. We need to
   confirm: dev builds against the OS 27 SDK, FoundationModels availability gates still hold,
   `SystemLanguageModel.tokenCount` and `GenerationOptions` are unchanged, and the test suite is
   green on an OS 27 machine. The "macOS 26 Tahoe required" gotcha messaging may need a note.

5. **User confusion ("why doesn't dev use Core AI?").** Once Core AI is in the press, expect
   issues asking why dev is not "on Core AI", or requests to run third-party models. We should
   have a one-paragraph canned answer (this page) so triage is fast and consistent.

## Opportunity: bring-your-own-model (future, likely a sister tool)

> **Update 2026-06-09: there is now an official Core AI <-> FoundationModels bridge.** The June 2026
> FoundationModels updates add a `LanguageModel` protocol - *"Adopt the LanguageModel protocol to use
> any large language model - server or on-device"* - plus open-source `CoreAILanguageModel` and
> `MLXLanguageModel` backends. That means a Core AI `.aimodel` (or an MLX model) can be driven through
> the **existing** FoundationModels session API (prompts, tool calling, structured generation) instead
> of reimplementing that stack from scratch. This is materially easier than my first read below, and
> it changes the spike from "build an LLM server on raw tensors" to "wire a `CoreAILanguageModel` into
> a `LanguageModel`-backed session and serve it." Still a separate project, but a much shorter one.

Core AI's genuinely new capability is running **non-Apple model weights** on Apple silicon from an
`.aimodel` file, with explicit compute-unit and caching control. With the new bridge it is more
tractable, but it is still a different project from dev core:

- It would mean shipping/loading model weights (dev today downloads nothing - "no downloads" is a
  selling point).
- The hard parts (tokenizer, sampling, KV cache, chat templating) are largely handled if you go
  through `LanguageModel` + `CoreAILanguageModel`, rather than calling `InferenceFunction.run` on raw
  `NDArray`s yourself. The spike should confirm exactly how much the bridge gives you for free.
- It fits the dev-family pattern (dev-tag, dev-spot, dev-mcp, dev-server-kit) far better
  than dev core. If pursued, it should be a **separate repo** (working name e.g. `dev-coreai` or
  `aimodel-serve`), evaluated with a research spike first.

Recommendation: **do not** put Core AI into dev core. Track it, write a spike against the
`LanguageModel`/`CoreAILanguageModel` bridge, decide later.

## Decision / recommendation

1. **No code changes to dev for Core AI itself.** Nothing to do.
2. **Add this page + a short README/FAQ pointer** so the positioning is clear and triage is fast.
3. **Open a tracking epic** covering the adjacent OS 27 / FoundationModels items above, gated on real
   OS 27 hardware availability.
4. **Park the bring-your-own-model idea** as a research spike for a possible sister tool, not dev
   core.

FoundationModels OS 27 updates (official, fetched 2026-06-09):

- [developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/foundationmodels](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/foundationmodels) -
  June 2026 entries: updated on-device `SystemLanguageModel` ("the model changes when a person updates
  to ... 27"), `LanguageModel` protocol, open-source `CoreAILanguageModel` / `MLXLanguageModel`,
  `GenerationOptions.ToolCallingMode`, improved error types, `DynamicProfile`, image analysis,
  `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel` (cloud, larger context).
- The on-device context window is **4,096 tokens on macOS 26**; WWDC26 session 241 shows **8,192 on
  the OS 27 on-device model** (see corrected item #1 above). The 32K+ figure is separate again - that
  is the cloud `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel`, which dev does not use.

Context / reporting: WWDC 2026 keynote coverage (2026-06-08) on the Core ML to Core AI rename, the
FoundationModels coexistence story, and the Apple/Google Gemini base-model collaboration. The
on-device base-model change and the new APIs above are confirmed by Apple's updates page; the exact
on-device context window should still be read at runtime via `SystemLanguageModel.contextSize` on OS 27
hardware rather than hardcoded.
